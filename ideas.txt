Either recreate timeline
- Basically convert timeline into readable text
- Then convert the text back into the extrudes and the proper files

Other idea is for every extrude or feature I find everythign associated kindaaaa

just like how git uses git to add to their repo we could do the same for the fusion files.

Need to type up a dictinary for the output data.
