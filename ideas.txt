Either recreate timeline
- Basically convert timeline into readable text
- Then convert the text back into the extrudes and the proper files

Other idea is for every extrude or feature I find everythign associated kindaaaa

just like how git uses git to add to their repo we could do the same for the fusion files.

Need to type up a dictinary for the output data - in data_types.py.

later seperate everything like profiles in one file or extrudes in another but the annoying thing currently is how do I support global vars over files.
We could move all globals to file like shown here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13034496/using-global-variables-between-files

mayeb isntead of adsk::fusion::ExtrudeFeature we have ExtrudeFeature

as I make every feature modular into each fodle rhave every test have the fusion tester file
later on I can make a custom tester
