This project is to hopefully have a standardized CAD format that is both readable and able to be used between multiple CAD formats
Then we could create a platform like NPM to have packages that people on any format can use and instead of being an STL it could be native

The export folder has all the code to export a file
The import folder has the code to import json info back into fusion
The global who probably have types and other globals which both libraries need
